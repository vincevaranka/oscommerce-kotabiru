2 CHANGES:<br />
<br />
1. Have included &quot;expand all&quot; / &quot;collapse all&quot; when viewing the list of customer testimonials in the store<br />
<br />
The list of Customer Testimonials in the store previously had to be individually expanded from their collapsed view and vice versa. Now they can all be expanded/collapsed at once using the &quot;expand all&quot; / &quot;collapse all&quot; option at the top.<br />
<br />
2. Have changed when the &quot;Write Testimonial&quot; button/link appears<br />
<br />
Previously if the &quot;Who may WRITE testimonials?&quot; was set on &quot;Registered Users Only&quot; in admin, visiting customers would not see the &quot;Write Testimonial&quot; button/link unless they were logged in. Now all customers will see the &quot;Write Testimonial&quot; button/link regardless of whether or not they are logged in. This is so that non-account customers will be aware that they can write testimonials, but will be prompted to create an account (or login) when they try to write a testimonial. Non-account customers therefore maybe more inclined then to create account in your store. <br />
<br />

<br />
The updated addon package includes 2 main folders:<br />
<br />
1 for a New Install of this addon if not yet installed (follow the full doco inside the &quot;New Install&quot; folder - this installs the complete package including the update to v1.1).<br />
<br />
The other folder is &quot;Upgrade from v1 to v1.1&quot; for users who have already installed v1 of this addon (follow the upgrade.txt inside the &quot;Upgrade from v1 to v1.1&quot;).<br />
(4 of the original new files to replace) <br />
